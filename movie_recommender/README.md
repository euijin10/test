# Movie recommender

### A web app to recommend movies based on user input

This recommender system uses two different models to determine the recommendations: **Nearest Neighbors** and **Non-negative Matrix Factorization** (can be selected). The models are trained on a reduced data set of movie ratings.

There are two methods available to get recommendations:

- **By favorite movies:** Select as many movies you like and get a recommendation for similar movies.
- **By rating:** Rate up to 10 arbitrarily selected movies and get a recommendation based on your rating.

This App was a weekly project at the SPICED Datascience Bootcamp from April to June 2023.

### Try the App

The app is automatically deployed to render.com using GitHub actions. It runs at https://movie-recommender-tfw7.onrender.com/, but might be slow or sometimes not available.

To use the Streamlit app, clone the repository, install the requirements to your Python environment and run the app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yotkadata/movie_recommender
cd movie_recommender/
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

This should open a page in your default browser at http://localhost:8501 that shows the app.
